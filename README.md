# Person in a Scene - Composite Image Generator

This project allows you to **insert a person into a background image** in a visually realistic way by:
- Detecting and extracting a person from the input image using **YOLOv8** and **REMBG**
- Cropping and cleaning the person mask
- Estimating height relative to people in the background
- Allowing interactive positioning
- Blending shadows, lighting, and color to create a photorealistic final image

### 🎯 Input

| Person Image | Background Image |
|--------------|------------------|
| ![Person](./assets/person.jpg) | ![Background](./assets/background.jpg) |

### 🔄 Output

| Final Composite |

| ![Output](./assets/composite.png) |

## 🎥 How it works (Pipeline)

1. **Person Detection**
   - YOLOv8 detects the person in the image
   - Bounding box is drawn, person is extracted

2. **Background Removal**
   - `rembg` removes background cleanly
   - Person is masked and cropped tightly to reduce unwanted space

3. **Scene Analysis**
   - People in the background (if any) are detected
   - Height estimation is done to scale inserted person naturally

4. **Placement & UI**
   - You can **drag and place** the person in the scene
   - Adjust scale, position manually or rely on auto-scaling

5. **Blending**
   - Lighting direction is estimated
   - Shadows and colors are blended to match the scene

6. **Download**
   - The final composite image is generated and downloadable
